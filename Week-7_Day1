Dr. Max has conducted the academic task in his class with 5 Multiple Choice Questions each having 4 options A/B/C/D. He wanted to write a program which can evaluate the test papers of all the N students such that each correct answer is awarded 1 mark and for incorrect answer penalty is 0.25 marks.

The program must read the number of students N and the the answers of all the N students in the form of a String. If any question is not attempted by any student, then X should be given as input corresponding to that question e.g. ABAXD

It is expected that the marks of all the N students are displayed separated by SPACE.

Input Format

First Line of the input reads the String of CORRECT ANSWERS

Second Line of the input reads the number of students N

Next N lines read the answer Strings of the N students respectively.

Constraints

N > 0

Input characters can be either in Upper Case or Lower Case

Else "Incorrect Input"

Output Format

Print the marks of all the N students separated by SPACE

Sample Input 0

ACBDC
2
BCXDX
AXXDC
Sample Output 0

1.75 3.0
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TestEvaluation {
public static void main(String... boys) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    String correctAnswers = scanner.nextLine().toUpperCase();

    int numStudents = scanner.nextInt();
    scanner.nextLine();

  for (int i = 0; i < numStudents; i++) {
        String studentAnswers = scanner.nextLine().toUpperCase();
        double studentMarks = calculateMarks(correctAnswers, studentAnswers);
        System.out.print(studentMarks + " ");
    }
}

public static double calculateMarks(String correctAnswers, String studentAnswers) {
    if (correctAnswers.length() != studentAnswers.length()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Incorrect Input");
    }

    double marks = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < correctAnswers.length(); i++) {
        char correctAnswer = correctAnswers.charAt(i);
        char studentAnswer = studentAnswers.charAt(i);

        if (studentAnswer == 'X') {
            continue;
        }

        if (studentAnswer == correctAnswer) {
            marks += 1;
        } else {
            marks -= 0.25;
        }
    }

    return marks;

Chacha Chaudhary has asked Sheena to find out the Nth occurence of any Word in the Paragraph. Sheena finds it a tedious task to find Nth occurence so she wants you to write a small java program which can solve her problem and she will give you a gift for helping her. Let us write a code.

Input Format

First line reads the paragraph contents

Second line reads the word to be found and N separated by Space

Constraints

N>0 Else "Incorrect Input"

Output Format

Prints the starting index of the Nth occurence of the word in the paragraph

Prints Not Present if not occuring even a single time and prints the last occurence if occuring less than N times.

Sample Input 0

Aana bought banana.
ana 1
Sample Output 0

1
Sample Input 1

Aana bought banana
baa 3
Sample Output 1

Not Present

import java.util.Scanner;

public class WordOccurrence {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner st = new Scanner(System.in);
        String paragraph = st.nextLine().toLowerCase();
        String word = st.next().toLowerCase();
        int n = st.nextInt();

        if (n <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Incorrect Input");
            return;
        }
        int count = 0;
        int index = -1;
        int lastOccurrenceIndex = -1;

        while (true) {
            index = paragraph.indexOf(word, index + 1);
            if (index == -1) {
                break; 
            }
            count++;
            if (count == n) {
                System.out.println(index);
                return;
            }
            lastOccurrenceIndex = index;
        }
        if (count == 0) {
            System.out.println("Not Present");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println(lastOccurrenceIndex);
    }
}
